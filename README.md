# Predicting diabetes using classification models. 
<br>
Can you predict the chance for an individual to have diabetes and what attributes can be used to make this prediction? This can be helpful in finding if an individual has the chance to develop diabetes before onset. I am admittedly not in the healthcare field, but one of the things that really intrigues me about the emergence of data science being widely used is how it is now being applied in healthcare fields and I know this is being done in the field and wanted to try and apply it myself.

Can you use classification models to predict diabetes in individuals?<br>
What attributes can be used for these models and what attributes are best to use?<br>
What are the applications of using these models in healthcare?<br>
Are there any ethical concerns of using patient data in prediction models?<br>
